                    <h3 class="information-head">Our Story</h3>
                    <p>
                        Rachel and Victor met at a saxophone gig in 2018. They were invited by their common friend, Toby, to perform at a corporate Christmas party. This was pure coincidence because Victor is a professional clarinettist and Rachel is not a musician at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Victor had already made quite an impression on Rachel in just a few rehearsals. Not just by making fun of her by telling her Coca-Cola Plus is salty (and Rachel actually believed it for all of 5 seconds), but also by walking her to the bus stop to make sure she got home safe after rehearsals. They exchanged their Instagrams and continued living their lives after the gig.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        They reconnected because of an Instagram story - Victor posted a picture in an ambulance after he had a motorbike accident. Rachel replied to the story just to check in, and they started chatting a lot more after.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Rachel invited Victor for a drink later on to celebrate his full recovery. They ended up talking all night. Before they said goodbye, Victor realised he could not let this girl go. He kissed Rachel and asked her if she would be his girlfriend. Rachel did not say yes in the moment, but asked Victor to try again the next day. Of course, Victor did ask her, and they have been there for each other for all the ups and downs of their lives ever since. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Victor proposed to Rachel on 3 February 2022 and they will have their wedding on 3 February 2024, exactly two years after the proposal.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
    
            <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
                <div class="l-box">
                    <h3 class="information-head" style="display: inline-block">Rachel </h3> <p style="display: inline-block">(according to Victor)</p>
                    <p>
                        Rachel’s intelligence and cuteness attract me, the absolute contrast between her working hard and playing hard is what makes her special.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rachel is a perfectionist and constantly brings me into a new world, she adds colour to my world and enriches my palate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Life is always full of love when Rachel is around, she shares the joy with me and supports me no matter how things go, day in and day out. Rachel is a girl blessed by God, and she shares all her blessings with me without holding back, which makes me the happiest man in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rachel, it feels like it took all the luck in the world for us to find each other. I promise to take that luck and turn it into blessings for you.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
    
            <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
                <div class="l-box">
                    <h3 class="information-head" style="display: inline-block">Victor </h3> <p style="display: inline-block">(according to Rachel)</p>
                    <p>
                        Victor is a kind and sensitive man. I admire his ability to see the good in people and his relentless effort to ensure people recognise their own good. He always says, “You will never be the best without understanding your advantages.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Victor can point out the bright side even in the worst situation, which makes him the best companion and the most supportive partner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love to look at Victor when he is working hard on his music and oblivious to the world around him. He is 200 percent committed once he sets a goal, be it professional or personal, even if he does not know how to achieve it yet. There are countless moments when he sets out to do something I initially think is not feasible, and blows me away with the end result.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are two very different people, but this is precisely what makes us perfect for each other.
