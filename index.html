                    <p>
                        Rachel and Victor met at a saxophone gig in 2018, they were invited by their common friend, Toby, to perform at a corporate Christmas party. This is purely coincidence because Victor is a professional clarinettist and Rachel is not a musician at all. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Victor has already made quite an impression on Rachel in a few rehearsals. Not only making fun of her by telling her Coca-Cola Plus is salty (and R actually believed itâ€¦for 5 seconds ðŸ˜…), but also walking her to the bus stop to make sure she gets home safe and sound after the rehearsals. They exchanged their Instagram and continued their own life after the gig. 
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        They reconnected again because of an Instagram story - Victor posted a picture in an ambulance after he had a car accident. Rachel replied to the story just to check in. And they started chatting a lot more since then. 
                        <br>Rachel invited Victor for a drink later on to celebrate his full recovery. They talked topics over topics until late night that day. Before they said goodbye, Victor knew he could not let this girl go anymore, he kissed Rachel and asked her if she could be his girlfriend. Rachel did not say yes immediately but asked Victor to reach out again the next morning. And of course, Victor did ask her again the next day and they have been together for every ups and downs of their lives ever since. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Victor proposed to Rachel on 3 February 2022 and they decided to have their wedding day on 3 February 2024, exactly two years after the proposal.

                    <h3 class="information-head" style="display: inline-block">Rachel </h3> <p style="display: inline-block">(according to Victor)</p>
                    <p>
                        Rachelâ€™s intelligence and cuteness attract me, the absolute contrast between her working hard and playing hard is what makes her special.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rachel is a perfectionist and constantly brings me into a new world, she draws the colour to my world and enriches my palate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is always full of love whenever Rachel is around, she will share the joy with me and support me no matter how things go, day in and day out. Rachel is a girl blessed by God, and she shares all the blessings with me without holding back, which makes me the happiest man in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I spent the luck of my life to be with you, I will make it into my blessing to you.
